Please, read about https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/guide/index.html#lambda[Micronaut AWS Lambda Support] to learn more about different Lambda runtime, Triggers and Handlers and how to integrate with a Micronaut application.

If you want to respond to triggers such as queue events, s3 events or single endpoints you should opt to code your Micronaut functions as Serverless functions.

In this guide, we are going to deploy a Micronaut serverless function to AWS Lambda.
